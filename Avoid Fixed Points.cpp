Chef has a sequence of N integers A=[A1,A2,…,AN]. He can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):

Choose any positive integer K and insert it at any position of the sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence, or in between any two elements).
For example, if A=[5,3,4] and Chef selects K=2, then after the operation he can obtain one of the sequences [2–,5,3,4],[5,2–,3,4],[5,3,2–,4], or [5,3,4,2–].

Chef wants this sequence to satisfy the following condition: for each 1≤i≤∣A∣, Ai≠i. Here, ∣A∣ denotes the length of A.
